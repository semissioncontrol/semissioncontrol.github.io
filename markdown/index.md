### Hello World.

Those were the first words printed on pretty much every developer's first project. Two words could not sum it up better. Programming introduces you to the vast abyss of technology, serial buses, CPU registers, and so on. Programming is beautiful, and infinite.

Which brings us to Space. Space, too, is infinite. As one of our most wise philosophers once said, 

> Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship *Enterprise*. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before!

That is indeed the everlasting mission of many humans, including the one that is writing this piece of text. 

Now, let's cut the philosophy. 

There are probably a few questions searing through your head. 

First, what is SEMC? 

SEMC, originally standing for Space Exploration Mission Control, is an Open Source project that aims to write software for Mission Control. That ranges from tracking flight paths, to managing communications, to writing custom drivers to get information from Earth to Mars. Although our goal has shifted past simply Mission Control to all of space, our ideaology remains the same - to boldly code where no man has written before.

We are a part of Nexus Aurora, which is an Open Source Project, that recently won the 2020 Mars Society Competition (and the Grand Prize of $10 000). Our idea is to innovate in technology past what we have today.

### SEMC OS

SEMC OS is our initiative to write an Operating System, or more specifically a Linux Distribution, for Mission Control. You can find this project [on Github](https://github.com/semissioncontrol/semcos "semissioncontrol/semcos"). 

### SEMC Modules

The idea is simple: write different modules, that achieve different requirements, then unify them under one core tool. That is SEMC Modules. Put simply: a million different apps under one roof that work for Mission Control and Space Exploration.
